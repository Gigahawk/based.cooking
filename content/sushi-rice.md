## Ingredients

- 2 (rice) cups Japanese short-grain rice ("sushi rice")
- water (as directed by rice cooker)
- Square kombu leaf (~4 in^2)
- 1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
- 4 teaspoons sugar or honey
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt

## Directions

1. Rinse the rice with cold water until water is clear. Drain.
2. Cook the rice as directed by rice cooker, put in kombu leaf if desired.
3. While the rice is cooking, heat the rice vinegar, sugar, and sea salt together in a 
   small saucepan over medium-high heat until just barely simmering.
   Remove from heat and whisk until sugar has dissolved.
4. Once the rice has cooked, transfer to a large mixing bowl and drizzle with the 
   vinegar mixture.
   Use a spatula to gently fold the rice until evenly mixed.
5. Cover the bowl with a damp towel touching the surface of the rice to keep it from 
   drying out.
   Let it cool on the counter or fridge until it reaches room temperature.
